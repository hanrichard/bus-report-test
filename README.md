### Assumptions

- We should have a UI lib, so, in this case, the Ant design UI library [https://ant.design/](https://ant.design/) was used in this App, some components have been used from the lib, for example:

  - Table

  - Spin

  - Accordion

  - Typography

- When we hit save notes button, the notes will be shown straigtaway and button will be hidden for now

- If there will be no result, "No results" message will be shown
